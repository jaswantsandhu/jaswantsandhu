### [JSSignal](https://github.com/jaswantsandhu/jssignal)
[![Node.js Package](https://github.com/jaswantsandhu/jssignal/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaswantsandhu/jssignal/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml)

**JSSignal** is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating and managing custom signals and effects, making it easier to develop reactive applications with vanilla JavaScript or within a larger framework.

### [X-UI](https://github.com/jaswantsandhu/x-ui) 
 
 JSON Config-Based UI Framework is a powerful solution built on Angular for dynamically rendering UI components and layouts based on provided data sources and UI configurations. This approach allows developers to create flexible, reusable, and easily maintainable user interfaces with minimal effort.
